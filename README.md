# Spoticode Generator

![Look at these waves!](https://github.com/kerichdev/spoticode-generator/blob/main/spoticodebanner.png?raw=true)

A simple python script to generate Spotify Codes (cool waveforms). Not scannable.

Simply uses the hash to generate the waveforms, with some smoothing and rounding.

## Usage:
`python3 spoticode.py a_word_with_no_spaces`

The file will save in the working directory.
